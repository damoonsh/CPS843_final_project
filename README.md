# The Role of Image Augmentation on Brain MRI Segmentation Accuracy

## Guide to the project
- The modelling is done on a [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/damoonshahhosseini/cps843-playground), different versions of the notebook can  be seen on the website where different training sets were used to train the model.

- Jupyter notebooks contain the EDA and augmentation processes.
